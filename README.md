# *bifrost-dl-core*

The hope for this open source project, is that it will expand the style of character rigging that was the backbone of the Rhythm and Hues studio that helped make it the character house that it was.  The indirect deformation methods may take a some time to get used to but in my opinion, is a superior method than vertex painting.

This is built around using Autodesk Bifrost and contains a number of compounds that can be used to build other compounds.  I decided to start working in Bifrost, as this already gives users in multiple Autodesk applications access to the same rigging procedures, which has been long overdue in our industry.  Hopefully Bifrost will continue to grow, and hook into many other applications.
